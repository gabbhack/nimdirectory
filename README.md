nimble.directory is permanently inaccessible due to backend errors. This project does not use a backend. All packages from [packages.json](https://github.com/nim-lang/packages/blob/master/packages.json) are downloaded at [build stage](https://github.com/gabbhack/nimdirectory/blob/master/.github/workflows/build.yml), information from them is used to generate static html files. The search is performed using [Fuse.js](https://www.fusejs.io/).

The rebuild happens once a day. You can find build time at footer.
